# MyReads Project

This project is my own implementation of the MyReads project in the course of Udacity React Nanodegree.

This simple app helps you track all your readings, splitting them into three categories:

- Currently Reading
- Want to Read
- Read

Search for books you want to track and put it into the appropriate category.
